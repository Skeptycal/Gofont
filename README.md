# Gofont

_A simple google font downloader written in Golang_

## About this project

This project contains my very first lines of golang. I created this project mainly because I want to try out Go (I really hate it so far).

## What does it do?

Just feed it an url to google font api and it will download that font to your desired location!

**Example of a google font api url**

```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Charm|Dancing+Script
```

## Todo

I'm still trying out Go so maybe I'll add some more features such as:

- [ ] Generate a CSS file pointing to the location of the downloaded font
- [ ] Make logger more colorful by printing the details with color
- [x] Cry a lot because I don't understand how Go `import` works
- [ ] Search for fonts on google fonts
